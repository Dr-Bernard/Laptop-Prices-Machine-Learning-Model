# HCIA-AI Machine Learning Class

This Jupyter Notebook contains practical experiments and demonstrations for an HCIA-AI Machine Learning class. It covers fundamental machine learning concepts and algorithms, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and potentially other topics as indicated by the notebook's content.

## Overview

This notebook serves as a hands-on guide for students to understand and implement core machine learning algorithms. It typically involves:

* **Data Definition**: Setting up sample datasets for experimentation.
* **Model Implementation/Application**: Using `scikit-learn` or similar libraries to build and train models.
* **Prediction**: Demonstrating how to use the trained models for making predictions.
* **Evaluation**: (Potentially) methods for evaluating model performance.

## Contents

The notebook is structured into different sections, each focusing on a specific machine learning topic. Based on the common structure of such classes, it is likely to include:

* **Linear Regression**: Simple linear regression examples, covering concepts like slope and intercept.
* **Polynomial Regression**: Extending linear regression to handle non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial features.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Steps such as feature scaling (e.g., `StandardScaler`), which is crucial for many algorithms.
* **Model Training and Prediction**: Demonstrating the `fit` and `predict` methods of `scikit-learn` models.

## How to Run

1.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Common ones for this type of notebook include:
    * `numpy`
    * `matplotlib`
    * `scikit-learn`
    * `pandas` (if data loading/manipulation from files is involved)

    You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook**: Open the `HCIA-AI Machine Learning Class.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment (Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook).

3.  **Run Cells**: Execute each cell sequentially. The notebook is designed to be run step-by-step, allowing you to observe the output and understand the concepts as you progress.

## Typical Code Structure (Based on common ML notebooks)

```python
# Step 1: Import dependencies
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Step 2: Define the dataset
# Example: X, y for linear regression or more complex datasets

# Step 3: Preprocess data (if applicable)
# e.g., Standardization, polynomial feature transformation

# Step 4: Fit the data (Train the model)
# e.g., model = LinearRegression()
#       model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Predict the data
# e.g., predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 6: Visualize results (if applicable)
# e.g., plt.scatter, plt.plot
